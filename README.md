# manjaro-post-installer
This is a manual and manjaro post installation collection containing MarkDown-Instructions and Scripts, to finish and polish a brand new manjaro in installation (to my needs). Feel free to use those scripts for your own purpose and/or create tickets, if you got any issue to fix or features to add.
