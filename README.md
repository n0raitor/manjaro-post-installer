# manjaro-post-installer
This is a manual and manjaro post installation collection containing MarkDown-Instructions and Scripts, to finish and polish a brand new manjaro in installation (to my needs). Feel free to use those scripts for your own purpose and/or create tickets, if you got any issue to fix or features to add.

# Step 0 - Manjaro Installation
I will go for the Manajro Gnome edition. In the future I will provide special instructions for other Manajro Editions, but for now, I will create these scripts and instructions based on Manajro Gnome Edition.

## Create an Installation-Volume
[https://manjaro.org/downloads/official/gnome/](https://manjaro.org/downloads/official/gnome/)
Use the Default ISO (not the Minimal or Minimal LTS)

The Minimal Edition does not contains Packages that follows a ">" on [https://gitlab.manjaro.org/profiles-and-settings/iso-profiles/-/blob/master/manjaro/gnome/Packages-Desktop](https://gitlab.manjaro.org/profiles-and-settings/iso-profiles/-/blob/master/manjaro/gnome/Packages-Desktop)

## Boot from the Installation-Volume
1 . Choose the tz, keytable, lang and whether you would like to boot from proprietary or open source drivers
2. Install Manjaro ;) (I recommend to encrypt your OS)
3. Boot Manjaro
