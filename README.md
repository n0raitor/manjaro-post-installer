# manjaro-post-installer

This is a manual and manjaro post installation collection containing MarkDown-Instructions and Scripts, to finish and polish a brand new manjaro in installation (to my needs). Feel free to use those scripts for your own purpose and/or create tickets, if you got any issue to fix or features to add.

# Step 0 - Manjaro Installation

I will go for the Manajro Gnome or Plasma edition. In the future I will provide special instructions for other Manajro Editions, but for now, I will create these scripts and instructions based on Manajro Gnome and Plasma Edition.

## Create an Installation-Volume

[Download Manjaro ISO](https://manjaro.org/download/)

Use the Default ISO (not the Minimal or Minimal LTS)

Use Rufus or Balena Etcher to Burn the ISO (to CD or USB)

## Boot from the Installation-Volume

1 . Choose the tz, keytable, lang and whether you would like to boot from proprietary or open source drivers
2. Install Manjaro ;) (I recommend to encrypt your OS)
3. Boot Manjaro

# Step 1 - Manjaro Post Installation

Choose your Desktop Environment and select the reguarding folder in the Root-Directory of this Repo
